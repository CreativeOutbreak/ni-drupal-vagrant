## New Int Drupal dev with Vagrant & Chef
We've now setup our [Drupal][2] development enviroment using [Vagrant][1] & [Chef][3] for collaboration, demonstration and deployment reasons.
### Setting up and running
First thing to do is to browser to where you want to work on your local machine and clone this repo. Here is some example code for making a folder in your home directory call *ni_dev* and cloning this repo to there.
```Shell
sudo mkdir ~/ni_dev
cd ~/ni_dev
sudo git clone https://github.com/CreativeOutbreak/ni-drupal-vagrant.git
```
If you don't have [git][4] installed, install it! ;)
Then run the previous code.
